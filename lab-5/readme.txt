Our solution is uploaded as the file 'myclassifier.m'. To classify an image 'Im', call 'myclassifier(Im)', such as in 'evaluate_classifier.m'.

Classifying the 1200 images in the training set gives an average precision of 0.935833. The classification consistently gives a performance above 0.90 for subsets of the training set. Thus, we expect a performance above 0.90 on your test data, given that it is similar enough to the training data.

The program classifies the 1200 images on an Intel Core i5-3370U in about 20 seconds, or about 60 images per second. We expect a similar performance on your test data set.
