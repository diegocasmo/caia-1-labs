Answers:

q1) No. We need both x and y. Assuming there are two clusters, there's no way a vertical/horizontal line can separate them.

q2) The histogram shows two 'clusters' of intensity, so using thresholding won't be able to separate those two clusters into three. This is because the ring (object) and the hand have roughly the same intensity values.

q3) Supervised classification with a linear discriminant. It assumes the data can be linearly separable.

q4) Yes. The three objects in the image can now be correctly classified.

Single band is better at separating the hand from the background because these two have different intensities of red, but it doesn't do as well when separating the object (ring) from the background (likely because neither of them have enough 'redness'). Grayscale has issues separating the hand from the object, as both of them have higher intensity values than the background.

Yes, using the three bands gives a much better result.

q5) Using bands 3,4,5 and 6, motivated by histograms. Using diagonal linear classifier, quadratic classifier gives error saying that the covariance matrix for some training group is not positive definite.

q6) The histogram of some of the bands look pretty much the same, so in terms of classification in doesn't make too much sense to include them since they represent almost the same data/features.
